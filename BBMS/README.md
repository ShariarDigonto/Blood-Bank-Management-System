Blood-Bank-Management-System

In an era where efficient healthcare services are more crucial than ever, blood banks play a pivotal role in saving lives and improving patient care. The "Blood Bank Management System" project is designed to streamline the operations of blood banks by integrating and automating the core processes involved in managing blood donations, inventory, and distribution. This system is developed using C#, providing a robust platform for ensuring reliability, security, and user-friendly interfaces. 
 
The system caters to three primary user roles: Admin, Employer, and Donor, each with distinct functionalities tailored to their specific requirements. Admins are responsible for overseeing the entire system, managing user accounts, and ensuring that the blood inventory is kept up-to-date and meets the necessary standards. Employers (likely staff members within the blood bank) handle the operational aspects, including processing donations, maintaining donor records, and managing blood distribution to healthcare facilities. Donors, the backbone of the system, must register through employers.
